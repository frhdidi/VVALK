# VVALK
Virtual Reality (VR) environment where player walks around inside a botanical park and collect trash, dispose them in appropriate recycle bins.
This project was created in 2021 as part of a compulsory course from UTP (PETRONAS University of Technology). 
The project aims to help botanical parks that were affected during Covid-19 by allowing 'visitors' AKA players to visit and experience activities there.
